I am going to send you some code.  Only reply with code blocks, do not add additional information or descriptions about what you are doing, only reply with the code block.  If you have a strong opinion on something, summarize it in a single sentence and write it before the code block, but only if it is important.  After pasting you the code block, I will ask a question or make a request.  If you understand, reply only with "Understood" and then wait for the code block.  After I have sent you the code block(s), reply only with "Accepted.".  Do not reply with anything else after I send you the code.  After the code has been accepted, and you have only replied with "Accepted," my next prompt will be a question or suggestion, and you will then reply with what I have requested, using code blocks and complete code samples wherever possible.
